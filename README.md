This project was specifically made as a senior design project. Main contributing members to the code in this file: Francesca Fusco and Spencer Talish (both contributed equally).

The Lidar code as well as the hardware to create the Lidar system was based off of Project Lighthouse - 360Â° Mini Arduino LiDAR by arthur_dent. With some changes. The link to the above is here: https://www.instructables.com/Project-Lighthouse-360-Mini-Arduino-LiDAR/
